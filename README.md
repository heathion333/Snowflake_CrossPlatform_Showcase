# Snowflake Cross-Platform Showcase

This project highlights Snowflakeâ€™s ability to run analytics across multiple platforms using:

- **Python (Snowpark)** for data ingestion and transformation
- **SQL** for aggregation and business logic
- **Streamlit** for interactive dashboarding

Built during my Snowflake trial to demonstrate real-time querying, cloud-native workflows, and cross-platform flexibility. Includes inventory analysis, category-level insights, and case-sensitive SQL handling.

## Files Included
- `snowflake_cross_platform_showcase.ipynb`: Jupyter-compatible notebook exported from Snowsight
- `inventory_analysis.sql`: SQL script for category aggregation
- `streamlit_dashboard.py`: Optional dashboard integration (if added)
